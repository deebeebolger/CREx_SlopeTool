Suite of Matlab scripts allowing the user to selected a temporal region of an ERP or several ERPs grand averages.
The minima and maxima in the selected temporal region will be located. 
The minima to maxima and maxima to minima slope coefficients will be calculated using least squares regression and plotted.
Clicking on the plotted regression lines allows the user to visualise the slope coefficient and the time (in millisecond) of the corresponding maxima and minima points.

The script presents the grand average of a single pre-defined electrode and the user can select the temporal region of interest (ROI) on this electrode. 
However, once a temporal ROI is selected on this individual electrode, the programme identifies the minima and maxima for all electrodes and subjects.
If the grand average plot presents the grand average of more than one condition, the programme will identify the peaks, maxima and calculate the slopes for all conditions, 
all subjects and all electrodes. This subject-level data is saved as a structure in the workspace as a 1x1 structure "AllSlopeData".
A window for each experimental condition opens showing, for each electrode, the peaks, minima and slopes of the grand average data. Clicking on the individual subplots 
allows the user to visualise, in detail, the peaks, minima and slope data for the selected electrode. Clicking on individual regression lines allows the user to
visualise the slope coefficient and the time of the corresponding minima and peaks (in milliseconds). 
This window also contains a plot of the entire epoch and a plot of the signal in the selected ROI modelled by polynomial curve fitting. 

To run the SlopeTool, run the script: CREx_ERPSlopeAmp_calc.m

Other scripts necessary for this tool are:
- CREx_getDataAnalysis.m
- CREx_peakfinder.m
- ClickonData.m
- SaveSlopes.m
